# Maze Solver
### Current Version v0.1.5

This is an automatic maze solver that uses known algorithms to find a the exit. The maze is kind of like a graph therefore algorithms like
- Depth First Search
- Breadth First Searcch (Coming Soon)
- A* Algorithm
- Dijkstra's Algorithm

Requirements

`Python 3.x`

Installation

Mac

`brew install python-tk`

Linux  

`sudo apt-get install python3-tk`

Check if you have it installed

`python -m tkinter`

### Version 0.1.5 Features:
- BFS algorithm implemented
  - A refactor maybe in place but the algorithm works.
  - Added a hashmap to keep track of the best path in BFS
- Input to edit rows and columns
- Changed colors to easily distinguish quickest path
- Choose whichever algorithm you want to use.
  

### Version 0.1 Features:
- Click to solve button

### Upcoming Features:
- ~~Input to edit rows and columns~~
- ~~Add Breadth First Search Algorithm~~
